# ClimateWins-ML

## Project Summary

Climate Wins, a European non-profit organization wants to leverage machine learning to forecast climate change impacts across Europe, with potential scalability worldwide. The project employs predictive models trained on historical weather data to anticipate and analyze climate outcomes, enabling better preparation and informed decision-making in response to environmental challenges.

## Key Questions

1. **Can machine learning models trained on historical weather data accurately predict the rising frequency of extreme weather events across Europe?
2. **Are supervised learning models effective in predicting specific weather conditions?
3. **Does prediction accuracy differ depending on geographic location and the range of climate conditions within the region?
